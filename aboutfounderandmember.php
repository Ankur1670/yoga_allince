                    Alliance USA. He began practicing yoga for the first time 16 years ago in his hometown, which
                    happens to be Rishikesh-the spiritual capital of Uttarakhand. For over 16 years, he has been
                    known as one of the most respected Hatha Yoga tutors in Rishikesh and brings traditional Iyengar
                    Yoga principles to his studies. Ravi is strong on values of discipline and ethics, and he feels

                    teaching in such an approach, he has instilled good inherent qualities in students, enabling
