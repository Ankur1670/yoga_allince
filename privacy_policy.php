        Every person has the right to the privacy of their personal information, which Sanskriti Yogpeeth recognizes and upholds. We promise to use the personal data collected on our marketing website in the ways that are specified and made clear in this policy.

            The purpose of the privacy policy is to outline the different kinds of personal data that are collected about site visitors, how those data are used, whether or not the data is transferred to or disclosed to a third party, and what options are available to clients or visitors to amend the data they have provided.

            This social media platform, <a href="">www.sanskritiyogpeeth.org</a>, may include links to other websites. However, Sanskriti Yogpeeth does not possess any knowledge or power to regulate how these external websites operate.
        </li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="600">
            We will never request personal information from users of our website that is not necessary for the operation of the site or for any other reason related to their private correspondence with it. Unknowingly, no personally identifiable information is obtained. The only thing that will be done for the same is a purposeful, clearly declared attempt. In order to initiate main communication, clients will be asked for their name and email address. If they make a reservation, additional information such as preferred dates, course selection, and type of accommodation will be gathered.
        </li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="700">
            No third party is given access to private information that has been duly obtained during correspondence with the client. However, in exchange for the third party providing services to Sanskriti Yogpeeth, we might share some basic information with them. Additionally, our management will use this basic information to get in touch with our clients in the future for marketing and feedback needs. However, the client has the option to refuse all such correspondence, inquiries for feedback, and marketing campaigns in the future. Sending an email to <a href="mailto:sanskritiyogttc@gmail.com">sanskritiyogttc@gmail.com</a> will allow them to voluntarily unsubscribe from further correspondence with the website.

    <ul>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1200">
            When making a reservation with Sanskriti Yogpeeth, we will ask guests to complete an extensive application form in order to obtain additional details about the course and accommodations. All employees and service providers of Sanskriti Yogpeeth, including the management team, will have access to this data.
        </li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1300">
            We guarantee that no third party user will receive the information obtained through the online application form without the knowledge and agreement of our customer. While we will take the appropriate action to safeguard the rights, assets, or safety of Sanskriti Yogpeeth, our employees, our clients, or others, we may also be required by law to act in certain situations, such as when a search warrant or other legal procedure calls for it.
        </li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1400">
            The client information thus obtained will be used for marketing, promotional, and future communication needs.
        </li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1500">
            The client has the discretion to choose whether or not to be contacted. We will give each client the choice to opt in or out while taking this into account. If they consciously choose not to be contacted in the future for whatever reason, they can opt out.
        </li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1600">
            It is up to them to decide how to use the client's personal identity information. They will be given the opportunity to add, update, or change any information they have previously submitted. One can carry out the adjustments by getting in touch with Sanskriti Yogpeeth's support team.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="mt-3" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1700">Miscellaneous</h4>
    
    <ul>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1800">
            We disclaim any liability for any errors made by our client in protecting their data. Using a computer in a public setting, sharing a computer with someone else, keeping the browser window open after use, and so on are a few examples.
        </li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1900">
            Our hardworking management team is solving and responding to our clients' questions. Any requests to amend, remove, or update a client's information will be implemented as quickly as feasible. In the same way, we would ask our clients to exercise patience.
        </li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="2000">
            The reliability of the internet cannot be guaranteed due to its exposure to many hazards and damages, such as virus attacks, hacker incidents, and other illegal access methods. In such circumstances, Sanskriti Yogpeeth shall not be liable for any loss, improper use, or theft of the clients' personal data. However, if a client notices the same, they should notify the management team right once. Any further legal action or strict action will be initiated right away, along with an investigation. Even though email is a viable means of communication, phone services are seen to be preferable because email accounts could be monitored by hackers or other outside intruders. In these situations as well, Sanskriti Yogpeeth disclaims all liability for the loss or disclosure of the client's personal data.
        </li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="2100">
            It is impossible to undo the intrinsic essence of time. Similar to this, customer data will be shared, transferred, or given away in the event of any merger, acquisition, consolidation, sale, or dissolution of Sanskriti Yogpeeth's personal assets. We assume your consent when you use Sanskriti Yogpeeth's services.
        </li>
        <li data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="2200">
            The company owns the privacy policy that Sanskriti Yogpeeth has established. They are able to create, remove, or change any policy rule. It is expected of the clients to frequently review the privacy policy page. Particularly if they intend to stay with us for a course or to communicate with us in the future. The organization would take action to notify the clients of any significant or noteworthy changes.
